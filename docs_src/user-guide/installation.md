# Installation

Installing PyGnome is simple:

```bash
pip install pygnome
```

This will install PyGnome and all its required dependencies.

## Requirements

PyGnome requires:

- Python 3.9 or higher
- NumPy for efficient array operations
- Pathlib for file path handling

These dependencies will be automatically installed when you use pip.

## Upgrading

To upgrade PyGnome to the latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pygnome
```

To install or update to the latest development version directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/pcingola/pygnome.git
```

## For Contributors

If you want to contribute to PyGnome development, you can install from the source code:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pcingola/pygnome.git
cd pygnome

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

Installing in development mode (`-e`) allows you to modify the code and have the changes immediately available without reinstalling.
